                <h3><a name="source" id="source"></a>Where did the data come from?</h3>
                <p> The original source of the each decade's data is the decennial 
                  census conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The electronic data 
                  collection presented here was compiled by the <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu" target="_blank">Inter-university 
                  Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)</a> under 
                  a grant from the National Science Foundation. The data selection 
                  was carried out under guidelines developed by the American Historical 
                  Association and reflect an interest in political and economic 
                  analyses.</p>
                <h3><a name="includes" id="includes"></a>What data are included?</h3>
                <p>The available data differ somewhat from decade to decade, according 
                  to what was collected in the census and the items chosen for 
                  transcription to electronic form. For the early decades, most 
                  of the enumerated items are included. For later decades, only 
                  a portion of characteristics have been transcribed. No information 
                  is available below the county level, and only states are included 
                  (no information on western territories before statehood, or 
                  for the District of Columbia).</p>
                <p>In addition to basic counts of population and housing units, 
                  all decades contain information on race, gender, and some measure 
                  of household size and composition. Beginning with 1840, some 
                  economic characteristics such as education and occupation are 
                  included. Later decades have many variables, including ancestry, 
                  literacy, and income variables. In a few cases, the census data 
                  were augmented with information from the U.S. Department of 
                  Agriculture and the National Council of Churches of Christ.</p>

                <p>The Census Bureau recently posted historical census tables 
                  on its website for direct access by users. Essentially digitized 
                  versions of census publications, these files are .pdf images 
                  of pages from census publications themselves and are not searchable 
                  through adobe or web browsers. Users should refer to the finding 
                  guides available with each publication. The <a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/index.htm">population 
                  and housing</a> files contain volumes published for specific 
                  censuses. Since data collection varied greatly from census to 
                  census, the contents of these volumes are not consistent. To 
                  date the Census Bureau has posted digitized volumes for the 
                  1790-1860 censuses but <strong>not</strong> all volumes within 
                  these censuses have been completed. Data in these volumes are 
                  reported on the national and state level, including organized 
                  territories. Links for retreving 1990 and 2000 census data are 
                  also posted. </p>
                <p><a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/index.htm">Statistical 
                  abstracts</a> have been generated annually by the Census Bureau 
                  since 1878. They contain economic and social data with an emphasis 
                  on commerce. Data in these volumes also are reported on the 
                  national and state level, including organized territories. Tables 
                  of contents are included within each topic of these pdfs. As 
                  of May, 2004 the Census Bureau has completed digitization of 
                  abstracts from 1878-1900 and from 1950-current year.</p>
