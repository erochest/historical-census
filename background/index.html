<h2>Historical Background</h2>

<p class="small"><strong>Note:</strong>This article is scanned and reprinted from: <i>200 Years of Census Taking: Population and Housing Questions, 1790-1990.</i> Washington, DC: Bureauof the Census, 1989. </p>
<p>  A nationwide population census on a regular basis dates from the establishment of the United States. Article I, Section 2, of the United States Constitution required in 1787 that</p>

<blockquote> Representatives and direct Taxes
 shall be apportioned among the several States which may
 be included within this Union, according to their respective
 Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole
 Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service
 for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths
 of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made
 within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress
 of the United States, and within every subsequent Term
 of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.</blockquote>
 
<p><img src="schedules.gif" alt="schedules" width="240" height="160" hspace="12" vspace="6" align="right" /> In
 subsequent decades, the practice of &quot;Service for a Term of Years&quot; died
 out. &quot;Indians not taxed&quot; were those not living in settled
 areas and paying taxes; by the 1940's, all American Indians were
 considered to be taxed. The Civil War of 1861-65 ended slavery (abolished
 legally through the 13th Amendment in 1865), and the 14th Amendment
 to the Constitution, ratified in 1868, officially ended Article I's
 three-fifths rule. Thus, the original census requirements were modified
 Direct taxation based on the census never became practical</p>
 
<h3>The 1790 Census</h3>

<p>The first enumeration began on the first
 Monday in August 1790, little more than a year after the
 inauguration of President Washington and shortly before
 the second session of the first Congress ended The Members
 assigned responsibility for the 1790 census to the marshals
 of the U.S. judicial districts under an act that, with
 minor modifications and extensions, governed census-taking
 through 1840. The law required that every household be
 visited and that completed census schedules be posted in &quot;two
 of the most public places within [each jurisdiction], there
 to remain for the inspection of all concerned..&quot; and
 that &quot;the aggregate amount of each description of
 persons&quot; for every district be transmitted to the
 President. The six inquiries in 1790 called for the name
 of the head of the family and the number of persons in
 each household of the following descriptions: Free White
 males of 16 years and upward (to assess the country's industrial
 and military potential), free White males under 16 years,
 free White females, all other free persons (by sex and
 color), and slaves. Marshals took the census in the original
 13 States, plus the districts of Kentucky, Maine, and Vermont,
 and the Southwest Territory (Tennessee). There is no evidence
 of a 1790 census in the Northwest Territory.<br />

</p><h3>Into the 19th Century</h3>
<p>Starting with the 1800 census, the Secretary
 of State directed the enumeration and, from 1800 to 1840,
 the marshals reported the results to him. From 1850 through
 1900, the Interior Department, established in 1849, had
 jurisdiction.</p>

<p> <img src="at_desk.gif" alt="woman at desk" width="240" height="144" hspace="12" vspace="6" align="left" />  The 1800 and 1810 population censuses were similar in scope
 and method to the 1790 census. However, Members of Congress, as well as statisticians and other scholars both within
 and outside the Federal Government, urged that while the populace was being canvassed, other information the new
                      Government needed should be collected The first inquiries
                      on manufacturing were made in 1810 and, in later decades,
                      censuses of agriculture, mining, governments, religious
                      bodies (discontinued after 19361, business, housing, and
                      transportation were added to the decennial census. (Legislation
                      enacted in 1948 and later years specified that the various
                      economic, agriculture, and government censuses would be
                      taken at times that did not conflict with those in which
                      the population and housing censuses occurred) The census
                      of 1820 covered the subject of population in somewhat greater
                      detail than the preceding one. This census is notable for
                      having obtained, for the first time, the numbers of inhabitants
                  engaged in agriculture, commerce, and manufacturing. </p>
                  <p>  The 1830 census related solely to population,
                      but its scope concerning this subject was extended substantially.
                      The marshals and their assistants began using uniform printed
                      schedules; before that, they had to use whatever paper
                      was available, rule it, write in the headings, and bind
                      the sheets together. </p>
                  <p>  The census act for 1840 authorized the establishment
                      of a centralized census office during each enumeration
                      and provided for the collection of statistics pertaining
                      to &quot;the pursuits, industry, education, and resources
                      of the country.&quot; The new population inquiries included
                      school attendance, illiteracy, and type of occupation.</p>
                  <p>  Through the census of 1840, the household,
                      rather than the individual, was the unit of enumeration
                      in the population census, and only the names of the household
                      heads appeared on the schedules. There was no tabulation
                      beyond the simple addition of the entries the marshals
                      had submitted, and there was no attempt to publish details
                      uniformly by cities or towns, or to summarize returns for
                      each State, other than by county, unless the marshals had
                      done so.</p>

                  <h3>Census Expansion</h3>
<p>  The act which governed the taking of the
                      Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Decennial Censuses (1850-1870)
                      made several changes in census procedures: Each marshal
                      was responsible for subdividing his district into &quot;known civil divisions,&quot; such
                      as counties, townships, or wards, and for checking to ensure
                      that his assistants' returns were completed properly. The
                      number of population inquiries grew; every free person's
                      name was to be listed, as were the items relating to each
                      individual enumerated For the first time, in 1850, the
                      marshals collected additional &quot;social statistics&quot; (information
                      about taxes, schools, crime, wages, value of estate, etc.)
                      and data on mortality. Decennial mortality schedules for
                      some States and territories exist for 1850-1880 and for
                      a few places in 1885; see page 12 for text and location
                  of records.</p>
					  
                  <p> <img src="man_at_desk.gif" alt="man at desk" width="240" height="193" hspace="12" vspace="6" align="right" />  Noteworthy
                      features of the 1870 census were the introduction of a
                      rudimentary tallying device to help the clerks in their
                      work, and the publication of maps, charts, and diagrams
                      to illustrate the most significant census results.</p>
                  <p>The general scope of the 1880 census was
                      expanded only slightly over that of 1870, but much greater
                      detail was obtained for many of the items -- such detail,
                      in fact, that beyond the basic counts, which were made
                      and released promptly, it took almost until the 1890 census
                      (because of budget constraints) to tabulate and publish
                      some of the 1880 data The census act for 1880 replaced
                      the marshals and their assistants with specially appointed
                      agents (experts assigned to collect technical data, such
                      as on manufacturing processes), supervisors, and enumerators,
                      every one of whom was forbidden to disclose census information.
                      Ever since the first census in 1790, some people had regarded
                      many of the questions as an invasion of privacy, but before
                      the 1880 census, there was no law limiting the extent to
                      which the public could use or see the information on any
                      schedule. (Subsequent demographic and economic censuses,
                      as well as most surveys, have been carried out according
                      to statutes that make compliance mandatory, with penalties
                      for refusal; and responses confidential, with penalties
                      for disclosure. Congress codified these laws in 1954 as
                      Title 13, U.S. Code.) For the first time, enumerators were
                      given detailed maps to follow so they could account for
                      every street or road and not stray beyond their assigned
                      boundaries. The National Archives' Cartographic and Architectural
                  Branch has a collection of these maps.</p>
					  
                  <p>  Again, in 1890, there was a slight extension
                      of the decennial census's scope, and some subjects were
                      covered in even greater detail than in 1880. Data were
                      collected in supplemental surveys on farm and home mortgages
                      and private corporations' and individuals' indebtedness.
                      The 1890 census also used, for the first time in history,
                      a separate schedule for each family. Herman Hollerith,
                      who had been a special agent for the 1880 census, developed
                      punchcards and electric tabulating machines in time to
                      process the census returns, reducing considerably the time
                      needed to complete the clerical work. Hollerith's venture
                      became part of what is now the IBM Corporation. Both the
                      cards and the machines were improved progressively over
                      the next 50 years.</p>
					  
                  <p>  The 1890 census was historic in another way.
                      In the first volume of the results, the Superintendent
                      of the Census wrote these significant words:</p>
                  <blockquote> Up to and including 1880 the country
                      had a frontier of settlement, but at present the unsettled
                      area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement
                      that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line. In
                      the discussion of its extent, its westward movement, etc.,
                      it can not, therefore, any longer have a place in the census
                      reports.</blockquote>
        <p> Commenting on this statement in a classic paper delivered
            in 1893, one of America's great historians, Frederick Jackson Turner,
            wrote, &quot;Up to our own day American history has been in a large
            degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence
            of am area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance
            of American settlement westward, explain American development.&quot;2
            The censuses that followed 1890 reflected the filling in rather than
            the expansion of the colonized areas, and this meant a turning point
            in American life.</p>
        <p class="toplink" align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3>Moving into the 20th Century</h3>
                  <p>  The 1900 census was limited to those questions
                      asked for all the population in 1890, with only minor changes
                      in content. The period, however, featured the first U.S.
                      censuses outside the continental States and territories:</p>
					  
                  <p>  Following its annexation in 1898, Hawaii
                      (where the local government took a census every 6 years
                      from 1866 through 1896) was included in the 1900 census,
                      which also had the first count of the U.S. population abroad
                      (Armed Forces and Government civilian employees, and their
                      households).</p>
					  
                  <p> <img src="punching.gif" alt="punching" width="240" height="205" hspace="12" vspace="6" align="left" />  The
                      War Department carried out an enumeration in Puerto Rico
                      in 1899 following that island's acquisition from Spain
                      in 1898 (there were periodic censuses from 1765 to 1887
                      under Spanish rule), and there have been decennial censuses
                  in the Commonwealth (its status since 1952) from 1910 onward.</p>
                  <p>  The Census Bureau compiled and published
                      one census of the Philippine Islands following their accession
                      by the United States in 1898; this census was taken under
                      the direction of the Philippine Commission in 1903. (Under
                      Spanish rule, there had been censuses in 1818 and 1876.
                      The Philippine legislature directed a census in 1918, and
                      the Commonwealth's statistical office began periodic enumerations
                      in 1939. The Philippines became an independent republic
                      in 1946.)</p>
					  
                  <p>  The Isthmian Canal Commission ordered a general
                      census of the Panama Canal Zone when the United States
                      took control of the area in 1904; there was another general
                      census in 1912 and several special censuses at various
                      times, but the Canal Zone was included in the U.S. censuses
                      from 1920 to 1970. (Sovereignty over the Zone was transferred
                      to the Republic of Panama in 1979.) </p>
					  
                  <p>  The United States occupied Guam in 1899,
                      and the local governor conducted a census there in 1901
                      and later years; the island was included in U.S. censuses
                      from 1920 on.</p>
					  
                  <p>  The governors of American Samoa took censuses
                      at various times after U.S. acquisition in 1900, and the
                      population there was enumerated in U.S. censuses from 1920
                      onward.<br />
                  </p><p>  In what have been the Virgin Islands of the
                      United States since 1917, the Danish Government took periodic
                      censuses between 1835 and 1911; there was a Federal census
                      in 1917, and the islands appeared in the 1930 and subsequent
                      U.S. censuses. </p>
					  
                  <p>  The Census Bureau took a census of Cuba under
                      a provisional U.S. administration there in 1907; there
                      were earlier censuses under Spanish rule (which ended m
                      1898), then a U.S. War Department enumeration in 1899,
                      and subsequent ones under the Republic (established in
                      1901) beginning in 1919.</p>
					  
                  <p>  Later in the 20th century, the decennial
                      census reports included figures for the Trust Territory
                      of the Pacific Islands. There had been quinquennial Japanese
                      censuses in these islands from 1920 to 1940; the U.S. Navy
                      enumerated in 1950, and the U.S. High Commissioner carried
                      out the 1958 census (the results of which appeared in the
                      1960 U.S. census). The Census Bureau conducted the 1970
                      and 1980 censuses3; in 1980 and 1990, there was a separate
                      census of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
                      which had been part of the Trust Territory.</p>
					  
                  <p>  A number of the censuses noted above collected
                      data on agriculture, housing, and economic subjects and
                      included enumerations on isolated islands, such as Truk
                      and Yap, mainly in the Pacific. </p>
					  
                  <p>  In some censuses, there were supplemental
                      questionnaires for American Indians; in 1980, enumerators
                      used these forms only on reservations to collected additional
                      information about households with one or more American
                      Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut residents. </p>
					  
                  <p>  From the 1840 through the 1900 censuses,
                      a temporary census office had been established before each
                      decennial enumeration and disbanded as soon as the results
                      were compiled and published. Congress established a permanent
                      Bureau of the Census in 1902 in the Department of the Interior,
                      so there would be an ongoing organization capable of taking
                      frequent censuses throughout the decades instead of concentrating
                      all the work in the years ending in &quot;0.&quot; The
                      Bureau moved to the new Department of Commerce and Labor
                      in 1903 and continued with the Commerce Department when
                      the Labor Department was split off in 1913.</p>
                  <p class="toplink" align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>  The 1910 census had several notable features.
                      First, prospective census employees took open competitive
                      examinations administered throughout the country (since
                      1880, appointees had been given noncompetitive tests).
                      Second, the way in which results were published was changed.
                      Those statistics that were ready first -- and especially
                      those in greatest demand (such as the total population
                      of individual cities and States, and of the United States
                      as a whole) -- were issued first as press releases, then
                      in greater detail as bulletins and abstracts, the latter
                      appearing 6 months to a year before the final reports were
                      issued.</p>
					  
                  <p>  In 1920 and also in 1930, there were minor
                      changes in scope. A census of unemployment accompanied
                      the 1930 census; data were collected for each person reported
                      to have a gainful occupation but who was not at work on
                      the working day preceding the enumerator's visit.</p>
					  
                  <p>  <b>Sampling.</b> In many ways, 1940 saw the
                      first contemporary census. One of its major innovations
                      was the use of advanced statistical techniques, such as
                      probability sampling, that had only been tried experimentally
                      before, such as in crop sampling in the 1920's, a trial
                      census of unemployment carried out by the Civil Works Administration
                      in 1933-1934 and surveys of retail stores in the same decade,
                      and an official sample survey of unemployment in 1940 that
                      covered about 20,000 households. Sampling in the 1940 census
                      allowed the addition of a number of questions for just
                      5 percent of the persons enumerated without unduly increasing
                      the overall burden on respondents and on data processing,
                      and also made it possible to publish preliminary returns
                      8 months ahead of the complete tabulations. The Bureau
                      was able to increase the number of detailed tables published
                      and, also by sampling, to review the quality of the data
                      processing with more efficiency.</p>
					  
                  <p>  Most population and housing inquiries included
                      in the 1940 census were repeated in later years, and a
                      few were added, for example, place of work and means of
                      transportation to work (1960), occupation 5 years before
                      the census (1970 and 1980 only), and housing costs (1980).
                      In 1940 and 1950, the sample population questions were
                      asked only for those persons whose names fell on the schedules'
                      sample lines. Sampling was extended to the housing schedule
                      in 1950, with a few questions asked on a cyclic basis:
                      One pair of questions for household 1, another pair for
                      household 2, etc., until household 6, when the cycle was
                      started again with the first pair of questions. In the
                      1960 census, the sampling pattern was changed for population
                      and housing questions alike: If a housing unit was in the
                      sample, all of the household members were in the sample
                      too. This scheme yielded sufficient data for accurate estimates
                      of population and housing characteristics for areas as
                      small as a census tract (an average of 4,000 people). The
                      only population questions asked on a 100-percent basis
                      (name and address, age, sex, color or race [and beginning
                      in 1980, Spanish/Hispanic origin, marital status, and relationship
                      to the householder) were those necessary to identify the
                      population and avoid duplication. </p>
					  
                  <p>  The sampling pattern changed in later censuses.
                      For 1970, some sample questions were asked of either a
                      15-percent or a 5percent sample of households, but some
                      were asked for both, thus constituting a 20-percent sample.
                      There was no &quot;split sample&quot; for 1980, but it
                      was used at every other household (50 percent) in places
                      with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants and at every sixth household
                      (17 percent) elsewhere. For 1990, the sample was tailored
                  even more to population size. (See p.98 for details.)</p>
					  
                  <p>  <b>New inquiries.</b> Reflecting the concerns
                      of the Depression years, the 1940 census asked several
                      questions to measure employment and unemployment, internal
                      migration, and income. It was also the first to include
                      a census of housing; this obtained a variety of facts on
                      the general condition of the Nation's housing and the need
                      for public housing programs. (Prior to this, the housing
                      data collected as part of the population censuses generally
                      were limited to one or two items.)</p>
					  
                  <p>  At the time of the 1950 census, a survey
                      of residential financing was conducted as a related, but
                      separate, operation, with information collected on a sample
                      basis from owners of owner-occupied and rental properties
                      and mortgage lenders. Similar surveys accompanied the subsequent
                      censuses. There also were surveys of components of housing
                      change with the 1960, 1970, and 1980 censuses (but not
                      1990, when the survey was scheduled for 1989 and 1991);
                      these measured the quantitative and qualitative impact
                      of basic changes that occurred in the Nation's housing
                      stock during the previous decade. The survey also offered
                      a measure of &quot;same&quot; units, i.e., the preponderant
                      part of the housing inventory that was not affected by
                      the basic changes. The first survey of this type had been
                      a key part of the National Housing Inventory in 1956. (The
                      housing survey inquiries are not included in this publication;
                      see the bibliography on p. 107 for references.)</p>

<h3>New Directions</h3>
                  <p>  <b>Processing.</b> The major innovation of
                      the 1950 census was the use of an electronic computer,
                      UNIVAC (for Universal Automatic Computer) I, the first
                      of a series, delivered in 1951 to help tabulate some of
                      the statistics. Nearly all of the data processing was done
                      by computer in the 1960 census, now with the further aid
                      of FOSDIC (film optical sensing device for input to computers),
                      an electronic device for &quot;reading&quot; the data on
                      the returns instead of having clerks prepare punchcards.
                      Special schedules were designed on which the answers could
                      be indicated by marking small circles. The completed schedules
                      or questionnaires were photographed onto microfilm with
                      automatic cameras. FOSDIC then &quot;read&quot; the blackened
                      dots (which appeared as clear holes on the negative film)
                      and transferred the data they represented to magnetic tape
                      for the computer at speeds that ranged from 3,000 items
                      a minute to 70,000 items a minute in more recent versions. </p>
					  
                  <p>  <b>Collecting the data.</b> The 1960 census
                      was the first in which the mails were used extensively
                      to collect population and housing data. The field canvass
                      was preceded by delivery to every occupied housing unit
                      of a questionnaire that contained the 10~percent questions
                      (those asked for all persons and housing units). Householders
                      were asked to complete the questionnaire and hold it until
                      an enumerator called. The sample items were on a different
                      questionnaire: In urban areas containing about 80 percent
                      of the Nation's population, the enumerators carried questionnaires
                      containing the sample population and housing questions
                      for every fourth housing unit. If the units were occupied,
                      the householders were asked to SU out the sample questionnaires
                      themselves and mail them to the census district office.
                      (The enumerators completed the questionnaires for vacant
                      units.) Self-enumeration had been used on a very limited
                      scale previously, but this was the first time it had been
                      made a major part of the decennial procedure. When these
                      questionnaires were received in the district of offices,
                      the responses were transcribed to the special FOSDIC schedules.
                      In rural areas, the enumerators obtained the sample information
                      during their visits, and they recorded it directly on FOSDIC
                      schedules. The 1970 census marked the use everywhere of
                      separate, FOSDIC-readable household questionnaires -- approximately
                      70 million of them -- rather than the large schedules that
                      contained information for four or more households. Thus,
                      respondents could mark the appropriate answer circles on
                      their questionnaires, which then could be processed directly
                      without transcription.</p>
					  
                  <p>  Subsequent censuses were taken principally
                      by mail -- approximately 60 percent of the population in
                      1970,90 percent in 1980, and 94 percent in 1990. The questionnaires
                      contained the 10~percent and, where appropriate, sample
                      questions. In areas where the mailout/mailback procedure
                      was used, enumerators contacted either by telephone or
                      personal visit only those households that had not returned
                      questionnaires or had given incomplete or inconsistent
                      answers. For the remainder of the population, most of which
                      was located in rural areas or small towns, postal carriers
                      left a census form containing the 100percent questions
                      at each residential housing unit on their routes. An enumerator
                      visited each of these households to collect the completed
                      questionnaires and ask the additional questions for any
                      household or housing unit in the sample. These procedures
                      were continued, with modifactions, for 1990. In many rural
                      areas, the enumerators, rather than the postal carriers,
                      delivered the questionnaires and asked that they be completed
                      and mailed back. In some inner-city areas, the enumerators
                      took address lists with them, checked for additional units,
                      and enumerated any persons they found living there.</p>
					  
                  <p> <b>Publishing.</b> For
                      1970, extensive discussions with census data users led
                      to a major increase in the amount of statistics to be tabulated,
                      especially for small areas. As part of the 1970 census
                      program, the Bureau published 100-percent (but not sample)
                      data for each of 1.5 million census blocks (including all
blocks in urbanized areas), as compared with
                      1960, when block data were provided for 750,000 blocks
                      within the city limits of places with 50,000 or more inhabitants.
                      For 1980, there were
 data for 1.8 million blocks, with the population
                      limit lowered to include incorporated places with populations
                      of 10,000 or more; several States were blocked in their
                      entirety. For 1990, the block statistics program was expanded
                      to cover the entire country, or approximately 7.5 million
                  blocks.</p>
					  
                  <p>The 1970, 1980, and 1990 population and housing
                      census data appear in series of printed reports -- either
                      on paper or microfiche, or both -- similar to those issued
                      after the 1960 census, with accompanying maps where appropriate.
                      In addition, the Bureau issued public-use microdata tapes,
                      usually containing much more detail than the printed reports,
                      for users with electronic computer facilities. After 1980,
                      some data were made available on diskettes for microcomputers
                      as well as &quot;on line&quot; through commercial computer
                      networks, and later in the decade, on compact discs with
                      read-only memory (CD-ROM).</p>
